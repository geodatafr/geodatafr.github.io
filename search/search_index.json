It was created from surveys obtained by airborne lidar or by correlation of aerial images. Lidar was deployed for flood-prone, coastal, and large forest areas. The vertical accuracy of the DEM in these areas is between 0.2m and 0.5m. Radar was used in mountain areas (Alps, Pyrenees, Cevennes, Corsica). Caution: in areas with steep slopes, the average vertical accuracy is the order of 7m. The accuracy of these fields has been checked against various sources: the road and hydrographic networks of the BD TOPO, geodetic terminals and points calculated on the ground. Aerial photo correlation techniques are used in the rest of the territory. On certain zones treated by correlation, ground measurements are absent over large extents due to the presence of vegetation (wooded areas, for example). 1987-2001 altimetry data (BD Alti) are used to fill these gaps.

It represents, over a depth of about two meters, the state of the soil water reserve in relation to the useful reserve (water available for plant nutrition). The uniform SWI is the SWI calculated by the SIM model and used by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France in the reports prepared for the interministerial disaster commission as part of the institution's contribution to the Natural Disaster mechanism. The use of these data and more broadly the role of M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France in the CatNat drought system are described in more detail here: http://www.meteofrance.fr/documents/10192/79826318/M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France+in+the+device+CATNAT+drought. The values are provided at monthly time step since January 1, 1969 with a spatial resolution of 8 km. Each monthly value integrates the current month and the two previous months: average of the three of daily SWI values.","title":"SWI (Soil Wetness Index)"},{"location":"METEO_FRANCE/SWI_Soil_Wetness_Index/#code-editor-snippet","text":"// The region of interest - a planar rectangle around France. var rect = ee .
